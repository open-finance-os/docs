## What is the Back-Office Portal?

The **Back-Office Portal** provides essential administrative capabilities for banks participating in the Open Finance platform. It's the control center where bank staff manage customer consents, monitor API usage, and ensure compliance.

### Core Back-Office Capabilities

**🔐 Consent Management**
- Track which customers have granted data access permissions
- Monitor active consents and their expiration dates
- Revoke or update consent permissions
- Maintain complete audit trails for regulatory compliance

**📊 Dashboard & Monitoring**
- Real-time view of API usage across the bank's Open Finance services
- Monitor customer consent status and data sharing activity
- Track which third-party providers (TPPs) are accessing customer data
- Generate compliance and usage reports

**👥 User Administration**
- Manage bank staff access to the back-office system
- Handle customer account queries and support requests
- View customer consent history and data access logs
- Administrative controls for consent management

**⚖️ Compliance & Audit**
- Complete audit trail of all consent changes
- GDPR-compliant consent workflows
- Regulatory reporting capabilities
- Data access logging for compliance reviews

## Built with Agentic Coding

This entire portal was built using **Claude Code** - demonstrating how AI-assisted development accelerates building complex financial applications.

### How It Was Built

**Starting Materials:**
- Open Finance API documentation (publicly available)
- OpenAPI specifications for consent management
- Standard web development stack (React, Node.js, TypeScript)
- Claude Code for AI-assisted development

**Development Approach:**
1. **AI-Generated Architecture** - Claude Code helped design the system architecture
2. **OpenAPI-Driven Development** - API client code generated from specifications
3. **Rapid Prototyping** - Core features built in days, not weeks
4. **Best Practices Built-In** - Security, error handling, and validation from the start

### Technical Stack

```
Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: PostgreSQL
Real-time: WebSocket for live updates
Caching: Redis for performance
Deployment: Render.com (production-ready)
```

### Key Features Implemented

**Real-time Updates**
- WebSocket connections for instant consent status changes
- Live API usage monitoring
- Dynamic dashboard charts and metrics

**Security First**
- OAuth 2.0 integration with Open Finance APIs
- Industry-standard authentication and encryption
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive audit logging

**Performance Optimized**
- Redis caching for API responses
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Progressive loading for large datasets
- CDN-optimized static assets

## Lessons for Hackathon Participants

### 🚀 Speed & Quality Together

The back-office portal proves you can build production-ready applications quickly without sacrificing quality:
