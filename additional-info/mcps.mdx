    Checking MCP server health...

    github: npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github - ✓ Connected
    filesystem: npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /your/path - ✓ Connected
    ```

    **Get detailed info:**
    ```bash
    claude mcp get github
    claude mcp get filesystem
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Integration">
    Open Claude Code in your project and test MCP functionality:

    **Test file access:**
    - Ask Claude about your project structure
    - Request file analysis or code review
    - Ask for help with specific files in your project

    **Test GitHub integration:**
    - Ask Claude about repository structure
    - Request code analysis across the project
    - Get help understanding the codebase

    <Warning>
      **If you see deprecation warnings**: These are normal and don't affect functionality. The MCP servers will continue to work despite warning messages.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ready for Hackathon">
    With GitHub and Filesystem MCPs configured, you now have:
    - Enhanced code understanding for AI assistance
    - Better project navigation and context
    - Improved code generation capabilities
    - Faster development workflow
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Hackathon Examples

### **Open Finance API Integration Workflow**
**With GitHub and Filesystem MCPs:**
```
# Ask Claude about your project structure
"Can you analyze my project structure and suggest how to organize my Open Finance API integration?"

# Get help with existing code
"Look at my auth.js file and help me improve the OAuth implementation for the sandbox"

# Understand the hackathon starter repository
"Analyze the examples folder and explain how the payment flow works"

# Code review and improvements
"Review my account data fetching code and suggest optimizations"
```

**Realistic AI Assistance:**
- **Project Analysis**: Claude can understand your file structure and suggest improvements
- **Code Enhancement**: Get help with specific files in your project
- **API Integration**: Ask for help implementing Open Finance API patterns
- **Error Debugging**: Share error messages and get context-aware solutions

### **Hackathon Starter Repository Integration**
**Using MCPs with the [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/open-finance-os/open-finance-hackathon-starter):**

```
# After forking the starter repository
"Analyze the hackathon starter repository structure and explain how I should organize my team's code"

# Understanding the examples
"Look at the examples/auth.js file and help me adapt it for our specific use case"

# Extending the starter code
"Based on the examples/payments.js, help me add recurring payment functionality"

# Environment setup
"Review my .env file and ensure I have all required variables for the sandbox"
```

**MCP-Enhanced Development Flow:**
1. **Fork** the hackathon starter repository
2. **Set up MCPs** pointing to your forked repository
3. **Ask Claude** to analyze the starter code and suggest customizations
4. **Iterate rapidly** with AI assistance on your specific features
5. **Debug issues** with context-aware help from your project files

### **Data Analysis Pipeline**
```bash
# Financial insights generation
@claude use postgres-mcp to extract last 30 days of transaction data
@claude use openai-mcp to analyze spending patterns and identify trends
@claude use elasticsearch-mcp to index insights for fast search
@claude use slack-mcp to share daily insights report with team
```

### **Production Deployment**
```bash
# End-to-end deployment
@claude use docker-mcp to build production containers
@claude use aws-mcp to deploy containers to ECS
@claude use redis-mcp to configure production caching
@claude use github-mcp to tag release and update documentation
@claude use slack-mcp to announce successful production deployment
```

## Performance & Cost Optimization

### **MCP Server Performance**
- **Local MCPs** (Docker, PostgreSQL): Near-instant response
- **Cloud MCPs** (AWS, Vercel): 100-500ms response time
- **AI MCPs** (OpenAI): 1-3 seconds for complex requests

### **Cost Considerations**
- **Free Tier MCPs**: GitHub, Docker, PostgreSQL (local)
- **Low Cost MCPs**: Vercel, Redis, Slack
- **Usage-Based MCPs**: OpenAI, AWS (monitor usage during hackathon)

### **Optimization Tips**
```bash
# Cache expensive operations
@claude use redis-mcp to cache OpenAI analysis results for 1 hour

# Batch operations
@claude use postgres-mcp to batch insert transaction data for better performance

# Monitor usage
@claude use aws-mcp to check current costs and set budget alerts
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **MCP Connection Problems**
```bash
# Check MCP server status
claude mcp list

# Get detailed info about a specific server
claude mcp get github

# Remove and re-add problematic server
claude mcp remove github
claude mcp add github npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

### **Deprecation Warnings**
**Issue**: You may see warnings like "Package no longer supported"

**Solution**: These warnings are normal and don't affect functionality. The MCP servers continue to work despite deprecation warnings.

```bash
# Example warning you might see:
npm warn deprecated @modelcontextprotocol/server-github@2025.4.8: Package no longer supported

# This is expected - the server still works
```

### **Path Issues (Filesystem MCP)**
**Issue**: Filesystem MCP can't access your project files

**Solution**: Ensure the path is correct and accessible
```bash
# Check your current directory
pwd

# Use absolute path when adding filesystem MCP
claude mcp add filesystem npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /full/path/to/project

# For hackathon teams, typically:
claude mcp add filesystem npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /Users/yourname/hackathon-project
```
