## 🎯 Why Choose Mobile for Your Hackathon?

Mobile banking is **highly valued** by judges because:

- **User Experience Focus**: Mobile-first approach shows UX thinking
- **Technical Complexity**: Native features demonstrate advanced skills
- **Market Reality**: Most banking happens on mobile devices
- **Innovation Potential**: Mobile enables unique features like biometrics

## 🚀 Recommended Approach

Instead of building a mobile app from scratch in 24 hours, we recommend using our **comprehensive React Native template** that includes:

### ✅ **Pre-built Foundation**
- Biometric authentication setup
- Secure API client configuration
- Offline data management

- Camera integration for check deposits

### ⚡ **Focus Your Time On**
- Open Finance API integration
- Custom banking features
- UI/UX polish and branding
- Demo-ready functionality
