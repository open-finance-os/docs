  const response = await fetch(`/api/accounts/${accountId}/balance`, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Accept': 'application/json'

  }

  return response.json();
};
```

### Real-time Updates
```javascript
// WebSocket connection for live updates
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.example.com/ws/transactions');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const transaction = JSON.parse(event.data);
  updateTransactionList(transaction);
  updateBalance(transaction.amount);
};
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
// Robust error handling for financial apps
const handleApiError = (error) => {
  switch (error.status) {
    case 401:
      // Redirect to login
      window.location.href = '/login';
      break;
    case 429:
      // Rate limited - show retry message
      showRetryMessage();
      break;
    case 500:
      // Server error - contact support
      showErrorMessage('Please contact support');
      break;
    default:
      showErrorMessage('An unexpected error occurred');
  }
};
```

## 🎯 Winning Strategy Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose the Right Scope" icon="target">
    - **Underestimate time**: Pick features you can finish in 60% of available time
    - **Focus on core value**: One great feature beats five broken ones
    - **Plan for demos**: Ensure your app works reliably during presentations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API Integration Tips" icon="plug">
    - **Start with authentication**: Get API access working first
    - **Use mock data initially**: Develop UI while waiting for API responses
    - **Handle errors gracefully**: Judges notice robust error handling
    - **Cache responses**: Avoid rate limits during development
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Technical Architecture" icon="code">
    - **Use familiar tools**: Hackathons aren't for learning new frameworks
    - **Prioritize frontend**: Visual impact wins competitions
    - **Keep backend simple**: Focus on API integration over complex logic
    - **Deploy early**: Get hosting working before the deadline rush
