Before you can do anything with the Postman, the first step is to **register your client**.  

1. Open the **`/tpp-registration`** request.  
2. Attach your **client certificate** and **private key**.  
3. Send the request to complete registration.

Once successful, Postman will display a **204 No Content** response — confirming that your client is registered.


### Expected Response

If you have followed all the previous steps in setting up  Postman correctly, you will receive a:

**204 No Content** response.  

This confirms that your client has been successfully registered and is ready to start interacting with the APIs.
