All Open Finance requests use mTLS as a security mechanism where both the client (Postman, in this case) and the server authenticate each other by exchanging certificates.

### Step 1 - Go to Settings → Certificates → Add Certificate
In Postman, client certificates are managed under the Settings menu. By navigating to **Certificates** and clicking **Add Certificate**, you open the interface where you can associate certificates with specific hosts.

### Step 2 - set the Host to *.altareq1.sandbox.apihub.openfinance.ae
The **Host** field tells Postman which requests should include the client certificate. By using `*.altareq1.sandbox.apihub.openfinance.ae`, you ensure that all subdomains under this sandbox domain will automatically use the certificate when making requests.

### Step 3 - upload the client_transport.PEM  file from the Client Pack into the CRT file
The **CRT file** is your client certificate, which proves your identity to the server. Upload the `client_transport.PEM` file provided in your Client Pack to ensure Postman can authenticate your requests properly.

### Step 4 - upload the client_transport.KEY file from the Client Pack into the KEY file
The **KEY file** is the private key associated with your client certificate. Uploading `client_transport.KEY` allows Postman to securely sign the handshake and complete the mTLS authentication process.
