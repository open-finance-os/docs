## Setting up Postman

### Step 1. Install Postman

If you don’t already have Postman installed, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Postman website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2. Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts.
4. Once installed, open Postman and sign in or create an account if needed.

### Step 2. Locate the Postman Collection

Within your Client Pack, you should have a file called:

`postman_collection_open_finance_hackathon.json`

Locate this file — it should look like:

```json
