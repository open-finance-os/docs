# Postman Collection

This **Postman collection** provides a guided sequence of API requests that help you:

- Obtain access tokens  
- Access Open Finance resources  

Following the collection step by step demonstrates essential workflows to test Open Finance capabilities outlined in the Hackathon Guide. It’s a **hands-on way to explore end-to-end flows** and see how endpoints interact.
