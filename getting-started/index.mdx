Hackathon teams have **two easy ways** to test, learn, and build with the **Open Finance APIs**:

1. **Postman Collection** — explore and send example API requests.  
2. **Hackathon Starter Kit** — run a full-stack sandbox app that demonstrates secure Open Finance usage.

## 🧰 Option 1: Postman Collection

The **Postman Collection** gives you a quick, hands-on way to experience the Open Finance API workflows.

It includes a **series of pre-configured requests** that walk you through:
- Creating consents  
- Exchanging tokens  
- Accessing account, payment, and product data  

You can view request–response examples step by step to understand how each Open Finance capability works in practice.

📘 See setup instructions in the [Postman Guide](/getting-started/postman/).

## 💻 Option 2: Hackathon Starter Kit

For those who want to **build and test full applications**, the **Starter Kit** provides a complete development environment.

This starter kit gives teams a fast, full-stack head start for building applications with Open Finance APIs.  
It includes:
- A **Node.js backend** (Express.js) for API routing  
- Secure handling of sensitive data using `crypto-js` and `jose` (for JWTs and encryption)  
- **Axios utilities** for making API requests  
- A **Vite-based frontend** for interactive testing and visualization  

You can run the kit locally, explore sample integrations, and extend it with your own ideas.

📘 Follow the setup steps in the [Starter Kit Guide](/getting-started/starter-kit/).

## 💡 Recommendation

If you’re **new to Open Finance**, start with the **Hackathon Starter Kit**.  
It’s the easiest way to see the end-to-end flow, understand how authentication and API calls work together, and start building something real.

Once you’re comfortable, use the **Postman Collection** to explore the APIs in more depth.

<Note>
💡 **Tip:** Both tools use the same Open Finance Sandbox — choose the one that fits your workflow best!
