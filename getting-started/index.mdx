# 🚀 Getting Started with Your Client Registration

To begin working with the Open Finance Sandbox, you’ll need to **register the client** provided in your **Client Pack**.  
This registration step links your application to the sandbox securely via the bank’s `registration_endpoint`, using your **TPP transport certificate** and **private key**.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Client Pack** — includes your:
  - Client ID  
  - Redirect URI  
  - Client Transport Certificate & Key  
  - Signing Certificate & Key

- One of the following setups:
  - Installed and configured the [Postman Collection](/developer-tools/)
  - Installed and run the [Hackathon Starter Kit](/developer-tools/starter-kit/)

---

## 🔐 API Endpoint

### `POST /tpp-registration`

Use this endpoint to register your client with the Model Bank.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl https://rs1.altareq1.sandbox.apihub.openfinance.ae/tpp-registration \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --cert path/to/your-cert.pem \
  --key path/to/your-key.key \
  --data '{}'
```

## 🔐 Certificate & Key

This endpoint uses **mutual TLS (mTLS)** with transport-level certificates.

| Flag | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `--cert` | Path to your **transport client certificate** (`.pem`) |
| `--key` | Path to your **transport private key** (`.key`) |

✅ Once registration is successful, you’ll receive a **204 No Content** response.  
Your software statement is now registered, and you can begin communicating with the Model Bank.

## 🧪 Registering via Postman

If you’re using **Postman**, follow the setup instructions in the [Postman Guide](/developer-tools/postman/).

After setup:

1. Open the **`/tpp-registration`** request.  
2. Attach your **client certificate** and **private key**.  
3. Send the request to complete registration.

Once successful, Postman will display a **204 No Content** response — confirming that your client is registered.
