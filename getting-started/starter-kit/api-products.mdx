title: API | Open Finance Products & Leads
description: Step-by-step guide to initiate your first Open Products request using the Starter Kit API, including obtaining an access token, and initiating the product request.
---


Unlike bank data and payment initiation requests, product data is non-consented. This means you don’t need to go through a consent flow, making the process of accessing this data much simpler.

## Step 1 - Get a `client-credentials` scoped Access Token

To create a client credentials token send a POST request to the following endpoint, with the scope `openid products`:

`/token/client-credentials`

<img 
  src="/images/api/Spotlight_10.png" 
  alt="/token/client-credentials"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>


```json
{
  "access_token": "a444a69e-1e97-4fc6-844f-e3ecfd71700e",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 600,
  "scope": "products"
}
```

## Step 2 – Getting products

Now that you have the required access token you can get the bank data payment by making a `GET` request to the following endpoint:

`/open-finance/product/v1.2/products`

<img 
  src="/images/api/Spotlight_8.png" 
  alt="authorize_endpoint"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

<img 
  src="/images/api/Spotlight_7.png" 
  alt="enter_access_token"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

Behind the scenes, this request triggers [Retrieve Products  (GET /products)](../../products-leads/) to the Al Tareq Sandbox Model Bank to retrieve the available products.
