            Optional parameter that can be used to send the User's Emirates ID or Trade 
            License Number as an encrypted JSON Web Token (JWE). This mechanism is 
            provided to allow LFIs to correlate the User identity, and therefore the 
            features of their account, prior to the User being redirected to the LFI's 
            authentication page.

            The value **MUST** be a JWE, encrypted with the target LFI's public key 
            with the User identifier set as the JWE. The payload MUST be a JSON object 
            created based on the Schema Object `AELoginHintJwePayload`. This JSON 
            object will form the basis of the data contained in the JWE, and should 
            be signed with the TPP signing key to create a JSON Web Signature.

            Please note that, as per OpenID Connect Core, `login_hint` is used for 
            discovery and is supported to provide hints to the LFI on the User 
            identity and therefore the data or services supported at the LFI. 
            `login_hint` **MUST NOT** be used to bypass authentication of the User, nor 
            should a request be rejected if `login_hint` is not provided.

            The `type` value of the `login_hint` property is shown as a `string` due 
            to the limitations of the OpenAPI specification in cross-referencing a 
            Schema Object that is also a JSON Web Token, as there is no deterministic 
            mechanism to display the underlying structure of the JWE payload.
            This property is therefore represented in both encoded and decoded 
            form in the API description using a `oneOf`, to help implementers readily 
            understand both the structure and serialized form of the property.
