      operationId: CreateAccount_signedRequest
      summary: Create an account
      description: >-
        Create an Account based on data shared from the LFI. The response
        provides

        an account identifier that can be used to retrieve the account details
        when

        the provisioning process is complete.


        Invoking this operation is driven by the User sharing with the TPP
        whether they

        already hold an account with a given LFI. There is no expectation that
        the TPP

        will automatically discover whether an account at this stage in the
        design as

        this could compromise data being provided by LFI with the quote.


        Please note that only **signed** request payloads are supported for this
        operation

        and TPPs **MUST** sign the payload as a JSON Web Signature, using the
        relevant 

        signing key.
