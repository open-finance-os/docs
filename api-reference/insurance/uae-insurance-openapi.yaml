        Create a employment insurance policy based on a quote previously created
        by the

        LFI. The TPP will send the `QuoteId` that has been saved by the LFI,
        together with

        any additional data that is required to create the insurance policy. The

        LFI will then invoke their BAU process to create the insurance policy.


        After the policy initiation request has been sent the User will be
        redirected to

        the LFI to complete the creation of the insurance policy.

        Create a home insurance policy based on a quote previously created by
        the

        LFI. The TPP will send the `QuoteId` that has been saved by the LFI,
        together with

        any additional data that is required to create the insurance policy. The

        LFI will then invoke their BAU process to create the insurance policy.


        After the policy initiation request has been sent the User will be
        redirected to

        the LFI to complete the creation of the insurance policy.
