After [setting up and running the Starter Kit](/starter-kit/index) and then [registering your client](/starter-kit/registering-your-client), you can start using the Starter Kit client it is available at [`http://localhost:1411/client`](http://localhost:1411/client).  

The client allows you to **walk through different Open Banking consent journeys** and **test some of the functionality**, giving a hands-on view of how the consent journeys and Open Finance APIs work.
