title: Registering Your Client
description: Before using the Starter Kit, register your client to start interacting with the Open Finance APIs.

Before you can do anything with the Starter Kit, the first step is to **register your client**.  

You can do this in two ways:

1. **Using Swagger API Docs:**  
   Open [`http://localhost:1411/api-docs`](http://localhost:1411/api-docs) and use the `GET /register` endpoint.

2. **Directly in the browser:**  
   Visit [`http://localhost:1411/register`](http://localhost:1411/register).

### Expected Response

If you have followed all the previous steps in setting up the Starter Kit correctly, you will receive a:

**204 No Content** response.  

This confirms that your client has been successfully registered and is ready to start interacting with the APIs.
