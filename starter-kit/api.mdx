After [setting up and running the Starter Kit](/starter-kit/index) and [registering your client](/starter-kit/registering-your-client), you can access the Swagger documentation for the available APIs at [`http://localhost:1411/api-docs`](http://localhost:1411/api-docs).

The API provides a quick and easy way to make requests to the Altareq Model Bank, following the [Open Finance specification](/open-finance-api/).
