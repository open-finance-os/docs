## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **macOS or Windows** operating system
- **Email address** - You will use this to create your AWS Builder ID account (or you can use an existing Google account)
- A code editor and/or terminal
- **For macOS**: GUI access for the application
- **For Windows**: Administrator privileges may be required for installation

## Setup Overview

The setup process consists of three main steps:

1. **Sign up** - Create your AWS Builder ID account (free personal account)
2. **Install Amazon Q** - Install and configure Amazon Q CLI
3. **Upgrade to Pro** - Subscribe to Q Developer Pro tier with hackathon support assistance

## Part 1: Amazon Q CLI Setup

### Step 1: Sign Up for AWS Builder ID

Before installing Amazon Q, create an AWS Builder ID account. This is a free personal account that you'll use to authenticate Amazon Q.

**Note:** While you can create a Builder ID during the Amazon Q authentication process (Step 2c), we recommend creating it upfront for a smoother setup experience.

#### Create Your Builder ID Account

1. Visit the [AWS Builder ID sign-up page](https://profile.aws.amazon.com/)

2. Choose your sign-up method:
   - **Sign up with email**: Enter your email address and follow the verification process
   - **Sign up with Google**: Use your existing Google account for quick registration

3. Complete the registration process:
   - Verify your email address (if using email sign-up)
   - Create a secure password for your Builder ID
   - Complete your profile information

4. **Save your credentials** - You'll use these to authenticate Amazon Q in Step 2

**IMPORTANT:**
- Keep your Builder ID credentials secure
- Remember your email/password combination
- You can use the same Builder ID across multiple AWS developer tools

For more information, see [Create your AWS Builder ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/sign-in-aws_builder_id.html) in the AWS Sign-In User Guide.

### Step 2: Install Amazon Q Developer

Now that you have your Builder ID, install Amazon Q Developer on your system.

For installation information, see [Installing Amazon Q for command line](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-getting-started.html).

Choose the installation method that matches your operating system:

#### macOS - Direct Download

1. Download [Amazon Q for command line for macOS](https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/amazon-q.dmg)

2. (Optional) Verify the downloaded file integrity

3. Double-click on the downloaded `.dmg` file

4. Drag the Amazon Q app into your Applications folder

5. In your Applications folder, double-click on Amazon Q to launch the GUI

#### macOS - Homebrew

Install using Homebrew with a single command:

```bash
brew install --cask amazon-q
```

#### Windows

Amazon Q CLI on Windows is installed through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), which provides a Linux environment directly on Windows without needing a virtual machine.
For step by step follow instruction from https://builder.aws.com/content/2ySpxVfiIsy46THpP6YdlYgQZpD/how-to-install-amazon-q-cli-on-windows

#### Step 2a: Enable Shell Integration

After launching Amazon Q, enable shell integrations to:
- Run Amazon Q commands from your shell
- Get autocomplete suggestions for 500+ command line tools
- Access inline completions with `qterm`

The GUI will prompt you to enable shell integrations during first launch.

#### Step 2b: Grant Accessibility Permissions (macOS only)

For autocomplete to work properly on macOS, you'll need to grant accessibility permissions:

1. The Amazon Q setup will prompt you for accessibility permissions
2. Follow the system prompts to grant permissions in System Preferences
3. Navigate to: **System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility**
4. Ensure Amazon Q is checked in the list

You should see a screen similar to this during setup:
```
Shell integrations: ✓ Complete
Enable accessibility: Needs attention
```

#### Step 2c: Authenticate with Your Builder ID

Amazon Q will prompt you to authenticate using the Builder ID you created in Step 1.

1. Select **Sign in with Builder ID** (not IAM Identity Center)
2. Follow the browser prompts to authenticate
3. Enter your Builder ID credentials (email and password you created in Step 1)
4. Complete the authentication flow and authorize Amazon Q

**IMPORTANT:**
- Use the Builder ID credentials you created in Step 1
- If you encounter authentication issues, verify your credentials or try `q login` from the command line
- Contact hackathon support if issues persist

### Step 3: Upgrade to Q Developer Pro

After authenticating with your Builder ID, you need to upgrade to Q Developer Pro to access all features. Follow these steps:

1. **Open Amazon Q chat** by running:
   ```bash
   q chat
   ```

2. **Initiate the upgrade** by typing:
   ```bash
   /subscribe
   ```

3. **You will see the following prompt:**
   ```
   Subscribe to Q Developer Pro

   During the upgrade, you'll be asked to link your Builder ID to the AWS account
   that will be billed the monthly subscription fee.

   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/amazonq/upgrade-builder-id

   Would you like to open the AWS console to upgrade? [y/n]:
   ```

4. **Type `y` and press Enter** to open the AWS console

5. **Copy the URL from your browser** after the AWS console opens. The URL will contain account linking information.

6. **Send the URL via email to slinsola@amazon.ae**. The team will assist with completing your Pro subscription activation.

7. **Wait for confirmation** from the hackathon support team that your Pro subscription is active

**IMPORTANT:**
- Do not close the browser window until you've copied the URL
- Send the complete URL exactly as it appears in your browser
- You will need Pro access activated before you can use advanced features
- If you encounter any issues during the upgrade process, contact hackathon support immediately

### Step 4: Configure Claude Sonnet 4.5 Model (Recommended)

By default, Amazon Q uses **Claude Sonnet 4** for chat sessions. For the best performance and latest capabilities, we recommend configuring **Claude Sonnet 4.5** as your default model.

#### Set Claude Sonnet 4.5 as Default Model

Run the following command to set Claude Sonnet 4.5 as your default model for all chat sessions:

```bash
q settings chat.defaultModel claude-sonnet-4.5
```

This ensures all future chat sessions use Claude Sonnet 4.5 automatically.

#### Available Models

Amazon Q supports the following models for chat sessions:

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (recommended for hackathon)
- **Claude Sonnet 4** (default)
- **Claude Sonnet 3.5**

#### Change Model During a Chat Session

If you're already in a chat session and want to switch models, use the `/model` command:

```bash
/model
```

This displays a list of available models. Use arrow keys to navigate and press Enter to select Claude Sonnet 4.5.

**Note:** The model you select persists for the duration of that chat session only. New sessions will use your configured default model.

#### Start a Chat Session with a Specific Model

You can launch a chat session with a specific model using:

```bash
q chat --model claude-sonnet-4.5
```

### Using Amazon Q CLI

#### Launch Amazon Q

From your terminal, simply run:

```bash
q
```

This launches the Amazon Q interactive chat interface.

#### Verify Installation and Model Configuration

Run the diagnostic command to ensure everything is working:

```bash
q doctor
```

Expected output:
```
✔ Everything looks good!

Amazon Q still not working? Run q issue to let us know!
```

To verify your default model is set to Claude Sonnet 4.5, start a chat session and check the model indicator, or run:

```bash
q chat --model claude-sonnet-4.5
```

#### Common CLI Commands

- `q` - Start Amazon Q chat interface
- `q chat --model claude-sonnet-4.5` - Start chat with Claude Sonnet 4.5

## Best Practices

### Optimize Your Prompts

- **Be specific**: Clearly describe what you want to achieve
- **Provide context**: Share relevant code snippets or file structures
- **Iterate**: Start small and build up complexity
- **Use autocomplete**: Let Amazon Q suggest commands as you type (CLI)
- **Use the right model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 for complex tasks (CLI only)

### Work Incrementally

- Build features step-by-step rather than requesting entire applications
- Test generated code before moving to the next feature
- Refactor and improve code iteratively

### Leverage Multiple Features

- **CLI Chat**: Use `q` for complex code generation and explanations
- **CLI Autocomplete**: Use inline suggestions for terminal commands
- **Debugging**: Ask Amazon Q to help analyze errors and logs
- **Model Selection**: Switch models during CLI sessions with `/model` if needed

## Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Credentials

**IMPORTANT:** Never commit your Builder ID credentials to version control!

### Code Review

- Always review code generated by Amazon Q before using in production
- Understand what the code does before committing
- Test thoroughly, especially for security-sensitive operations
- Be cautious with code that handles sensitive data or credentials

### Token Usage

Your Q Developer Pro subscription provides access to advanced features:
