    ## UAE Open Finance Authorization Endpoints Specification


    This API description provides the API descriptions for two OAuth 2.0 operations included in the FAPI 2.0 Security
    Profile:


    * [Pushed Authorization Requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126), which implement [Rich
    Authorization Requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9396) (RAR) payloads to provide Consent for a given
    use case.


    * Token operations that provide details of the RAR associated with a given Access Token request.


    Please note that the Authorization Request is provided as a plain JSON object, which only describes the payload of a
    signed JSON Web Token (JWS).


    Users of this API description must ensure they implement the Authorization Request as a JWS, encoding the payload as
    described by [RFC 7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515) and reflecting the requirements of the API
    Security Profile for the UAE Open Finance Framework.

            Optional parameter that can be used to send the User's Emirates ID or Trade
            License Number as an encrypted JSON Web Token (JWE). This mechanism is
            provided to allow LFIs to correlate the User identity, and therefore the
            features of their account, prior to the User being redirected to the LFI's
            authentication page.

            The value **MUST** be a JWE, encrypted with the target LFI's public key
            with the User identifier set as the JWE. The payload MUST be a JSON object
            created based on the Schema Object `AELoginHintJwePayload`. This JSON
            object will form the basis of the data contained in the JWE, and should
            be signed with the TPP signing key to create a JSON Web Signature.

            Please note that, as per OpenID Connect Core, `login_hint` is used for
            discovery and is supported to provide hints to the LFI on the User
            identity and therefore the data or services supported at the LFI.
            `login_hint` **MUST NOT** be used to bypass authentication of the User, nor
            should a request be rejected if `login_hint` is not provided.

            The `type` value of the `login_hint` property is shown as a `string` due
            to the limitations of the OpenAPI specification in cross-referencing a
            Schema Object that is also a JSON Web Token, as there is no deterministic
            mechanism to display the underlying structure of the JWE payload.
            This property is therefore represented in both encoded and decoded
            form in the API description using a `oneOf`, to help implementers readily
            understand both the structure and serialized form of the property.

            Optional parameter that can be used to send the User's Emirates ID or Trade
            License Number as an encrypted JSON Web Token (JWE). This mechanism is
            provided to allow LFIs to correlate the User identity, and therefore the
            features of their account, prior to the User being redirected to the LFI's
            authentication page.

            The value **MUST** be a JWE, encrypted with the target LFI's public key
            with the User identifier set as the JWE. The payload MUST be a JSON object
            created based on the Schema Object `AELoginHintJwePayload`. This JSON
            object will form the basis of the data contained in the JWE, and should
            be signed with the TPP signing key to create a JSON Web Signature.

            Please note that, as per OpenID Connect Core, `login_hint` is used for
            discovery and is supported to provide hints to the LFI on the User
            identity and therefore the data or services supported at the LFI.
            `login_hint` **MUST NOT** be used to bypass authentication of the User, nor
            should a request be rejected if `login_hint` is not provided.

            The `type` value of the `login_hint` property is shown as a `string` due
            to the limitations of the OpenAPI specification in cross-referencing a
            Schema Object that is also a JSON Web Token, as there is no deterministic
            mechanism to display the underlying structure of the JWE payload.
            This property is therefore represented in both encoded and decoded
            form in the API description using a `oneOf`, to help implementers readily
            understand both the structure and serialized form of the property.
